When the client is started, it will construct query objects according to the command line parameters, and then encapsulate these query objects into framer and send them through tcp.
After the server is started, it will always listen on the specified port, and when a new connection arrives, it will submit the request to the thread pool for processing. In the thread pool, the data is first decoded, a query object is constructed, and then masterfile is called to obtain the result of the query, and the masterfile will go to 129.62.148.40 to obtain the result of this query through udp. After getting the results, encapsulate the results into a Response object and send it back to the client
